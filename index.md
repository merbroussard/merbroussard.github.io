My new book is [*Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/artificial-unintelligence). The book is a guide to understanding the inner workings and outer limits of technology. It explains why we should never assume that computers always get it right.

The book was published in April 2018 by MIT Press. It is available for order the book at [Powell's](http://www.powells.com/book/artificial-unintelligence-9780262038003/61-0) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Unintelligence-Computers-Misunderstand-World/dp/0262038005) or [anywhere books are sold](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/artificial-unintelligence).
