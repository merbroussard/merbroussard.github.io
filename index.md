My new book is [*Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/artificial-unintelligence). The book is a guide to understanding the inner workings and outer limits of technology. It explains why we should never assume that computers always get it right.

The book was published in April 2018 by MIT Press and was awarded the [2019 PROSE Award for the best book in computing & information sciences](https://proseawards.com/winners/2019-award-winners) by the Association of American Publishers. It is available for order at [Powell's](http://www.powells.com/book/artificial-unintelligence-9780262038003/61-0) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Unintelligence-Computers-Misunderstand-World/dp/0262038005) or [anywhere books are sold](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/artificial-unintelligence). You can [read the first chapter](https://mitpress.mit.edu/read/hello-reader) online. The book has been adopted in technology & society courses around the world.

I speak frequently on artificial intelligence, AI ethics, data journalism, and education. To book a lecture, please email meredith.broussard.office at gmail. 

“Finally! A book by a clear-headed, articulate expert who not only dwells on all manner of nerdly delights but has the wisdom to anticipate the problems with blind faith, projected AI consciousness, and illogical magical thinking that so often comes with computers and artificial intelligence. Meredith Broussard has a superpower and it’s not (only) that she can program-- it’s that she can explain what that means and what it doesn’t.” 
-- [Cathy O’Neil, author of Weapons of Math Destruction](https://mathbabe.org/)

“If you want to grasp the practical implications of the turn to artificial intelligence, read this book. Broussard provides an insightful, personal glimpse into a complex field.”

-- [Kate Crawford, NYU Distinguished Research Professor; cofounder of the AI Now Institute](https://ainowinstitute.org/)
