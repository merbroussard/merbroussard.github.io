My new book will be published in April 2018 by MIT Press. [*Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/artificial-unintelligence) is a guide to understanding the inner workings and outer limits of technology and why we should never assume that computers always get it right.

Preorder the book at [Powell's](http://www.powells.com/book/artificial-unintelligence-9780262038003/61-0) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Unintelligence-Computers-Misunderstand-World/dp/0262038005)
